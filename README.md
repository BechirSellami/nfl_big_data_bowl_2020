# NFL BIG DATA BOWL 2020

This notebook is an attempt to reproduce the winning solution of the "NFL Big data bowl 2020" competition hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020). In fact, the winning team provided a high level description of their approach to solve this challenge, however, they didn't share the code implementation itself. 
Therefore, I'll attempt to reproduce the data cleaning, feature engineering and model building steps based on the available information. This implementation is in Keras.
